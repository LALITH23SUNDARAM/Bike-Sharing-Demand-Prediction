## Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

**Abstract:** Bike sharing system is one of emerging business in many countries. Here a person can rent bikes  for a short time period. The main motive is to reduce movement of cars and resolve traffic problems. Since its minimal human intervention process, providing seemless service to riders is key factor for any company. One of the main hurdle on their way is, How much bikes should they have to hold in a dock to provide effective service. This project, acknowledge business problem by structuring a regression type predictive model.

### Approach to Problem

We provided with past 12 months riders pattern of users in Seoul, a South Korean city.

### RoadMap:

* Handled Missing Values 

* Understands the Data Distribution.

* Cap and Floor the extreme values.

* Explore the Relation between Dependent and Independent variables. Checked Multicollinearity.

* Train-Test Split

* Model Training

   * Decision Tree
   * Random Forest
   * eXtreme Gradient Boosting Machine

* Hyperparametre Tuning & Cross-Validation

* Evaluating Model Performance.
    * Root Mean Sqaure Error(RMSE)
    * R-Sqaure

* Model Interpretability using SHAP values.
